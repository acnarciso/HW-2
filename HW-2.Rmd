## Admistrative:

Please indicate

* Who you collaborated with: none
* Roughly how much time you spent on this HW so far: 10 hours
* The URL of the RPubs published URL [here](http://rpubs.com/anarciso/HW-2).
* What gave you the most trouble: fct_reorder, deciding what exactly to investigate
* Any comments you have:



## Question 1:

Perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the `profiles` data set,
specifically on the relationship between gender and

* `income`
* `job`
* One more categorical variable of your choice

all keeping in mind in HW-3, you will be fitting a logistic regression to
predict a user's gender based on these variables.

1. Gender and Income

Figure 1 shows that 12.9% of females reported an income, and 23.4% of males reported an income, which is almost double the percentage of females. 

Figure 2 supports the correlation illustrated in Figure 1, wherein a greater percentage of males reported an income than females. Interestingly, Figure 2 shows that at the age of 30, there is a dip in the percentage of both males and females that reported an income. This could be because people are most insecure regarding their income at around age 30, fearing that they should be more successful and be earning more money at that point in their lives. I decided to disclude all individuals with a reported age greater than 70, as these did not represent the general trend of the data Additionally, there is a high likelyhood that the data for this group of people is made up, as the data is self-reported and there is a very low chance that people over the age of 70 are using this social platform.  

Figure 3.1 and 3.2 represent the individuals that did report an income. Figure 3.1 shows the number of males and females within each income category, and Figure 3.2 shows the proportion of males to females within each income category. In Figure 3.2, I added a y-intercept of 0.402, which represents the proportion of the population that is female. This gives a point of comparison, so that people reading the graph know how equal the proportions of men and women are within each income category. I chose to categorize individuals into the 4 following income groups: 
no_reply: didn't report an income
low_income: income < 50,000
mid_income: 50,000 <= income <= 100,000
high_income: income > 100,000
Figure 3.2 shows that the higher the income, the greater proportion of men reported to be within that group. This could be because men do make more money than women, or because there is a greater social pressure for men to have a high salary and thus, they are more inclined to inflate their income on a dating site. 

2. Gender and Job

Figure 4.1 further breaks down the difference between males and females, by looking at the ratio of the sexes within each job field. Again, I added a line indicating the proportion of women within the sample population. Thus, any bars that fall short of the line represent job fields where women make up less than half of the population and vice versa. This graph shows that women are the majority in medicine / health, education / academia and clinical administrative, and overwhelmingly the minority in science / tech / engineering, computer/ hardware / software, construction / craftsmanship, transportation and the military. 
Figure 4.2 shows the number of males and females within each job field. This provides a point of comparison allowing you to compare the number of people within each industry.

3. Gender and Offspring

Figure 5.1 shows the proportion of men and women with respect to their answer regarding offspring, and Figure 5.2 shows the count. Again, I added the bar representing the proportion of women within the data set. I split the responses into 3 categories:
no_ans: they did not give an answer
wants_kids: they want, might want or already have kids
doesnt_want_kids: they dont want or have kids
Slightly more women than men don't want kids, an even greater proportion of women do want kids, but less women than men did not give a response. (in relation to 40% being the indication of a 50:50 split)

## Question 2:

In the file `HW-2_Shiny_App.Rmd`, build the Shiny App discussed in Lec09 on
Monday 10/3: Using the `movies` data set in the `ggplot2movies` data set, make a
Shiny app that

* Plots budget on the x-axis and rating on the y-axis
* Instead of having a radio button to select the genre of movie (`Action`,
`Animation`, `Comedy`, etc), have a radio button that allows you to toggle
between comedies and non-comedies. This app should be simpler.
